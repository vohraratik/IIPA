                      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      The Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) was entrusted by the National Disaster
                      Management Authority (NDMA), Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India to evaluate the project
                      on “M 8.7 Shillong 1897 Earthquake Scenario: NE Multi State Preparedness Campaign Project”
                      conducted by CSIR-NEIST, Jorhat in collaboration with NDMA. The project evaluated three main
                      activities, generating awareness, mass casualty management in schools and hospitals, and capacity
                      building of various stakeholders to evolve the coordinated evaluation of SDMAs and NDMA. The
                      primary and secondary data collection techniques were used for the evaluation, comprising
                      interaction with stakeholders, on-site data collection, series of interviews, Google forms,
                      consultative meetings, brainstorming sessions, and discussions with the concerned officers of
                      NDMA. The findings of the project revealed that the project was unique, timely, and successfully
                      synced with the participation of nodal agencies and line departments. The states and districts
                      need to revisit their Disaster Management plans in the light of new development, launch functional
                      EoCs, establish a stand-alone disaster network, provide for State Response Plan, emphasis on
                      Micro-Zonation, enforce strict implementation of Building Code and RVS training, and have a
                      well-structured Hospital Contingency Plan. The project also revealed the need for a dedicated
                      disaster communication network and a Special DM module for Police Personnel. The capacity building
                      should have been two-pronged, one to capacitate NEIST to disseminate scientific research to
                      functional aspects in the state, and the second prong should have been SDMA/NDMA to use scientific
                      knowledge in their response mechanism. The project states may be requested to identify lessons
                      learned and prepare a separate “State Response Plan”. The study found that the CDP trainings were
                      very efficient in enhancing knowledge about Emergency Response Plan and Standard Operation
                      Procedures, whereas the gaps existed in manpower and equipment procurement. The role of Print
                      Media was appreciated in generating awareness among the public. The findings of the project helped
                      in identifying gaps in the formulation of the strategy for disaster preparedness and provided
                      recommendations to improve the design and implementation of earthquake scenario project activities
                      in the country.

                    </div>
                    <p>The mega mock exercise was conducted by CSIR-NEIST jointly with NDMA covering 17 cities
                      and 80+ locations. Due to vast spread of region and difficult terrain, transportation and
                      logistics
                      constraints the Mega Mock Exercise was conducted in two phases. The main objective of Mega
                      Mock Exercise was to review the state DM plans and to assess the preparedness in response, to
                      develop an understanding of direct and indirect consequences in response to a hypothetical
                      earthquake disaster incidence. The Mega Mock exercise also helped in identifying gaps in
                      Disaster Management and response mechanism and to enhance community resilience. Mega
                      Mock Exercise included a lot of preparedness work such as organization of thirty CDPs for IRS,
                      TTx and Mock Drills, RVS trainings of State engineers and architects, customized media
                      campaign viz. advertisements in newspaper, radio, TV, radio jingles, organization of rallies,
                      street plays, painting, competitions pulling up of posters and hoardings, SMS alerts, distribution
                      of posters and earthquake preparedness guide and resource inventory mechanism.

                      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) collaborated with the Council of Scientific and
                      Industrial Research – North East Institute of Science and Technology (CSIR-NEIST) to create a
                      dynamic initiative to develop an earthquake disaster scenario. The project catered to the eight
                      Northeastern states, with the intensity of the earthquake ranging from VIII to IX, depending on
                      the state. The project aimed to create mass awareness and sensitization amongst the masses, as
                      well as capacity development programs, rapid visual surveys, school children sensitization, and
                      table-top exercises, among others. While the project was successful, there were still a few gaps
                      that need to be plugged in future ventures. These gaps include the need to groom states as future
                      ambassadors, the need for two-pronged capacity building, regular revisits of disaster management
                      plans, and wider outreach of scientific findings.
                      <br>
                      The project successfully looped in all major stakeholders, with a general enthusiasm and
                      willingness to learn despite the state and general elections in a few states. It also generated a
                      lot of mass awareness and sensitization among the masses, while technicalities such as
                      micro-zonation of seismic activities were brought forward. New programs such as “GyanJyoti”
                      program, an initiative of the Assam Government, and “Science Motivation Programme,” a CSIR
                      initiative, were started as an inspiration from this mega project. The study team also found that
                      the overall coordination between different line departments was at its best during the mega mock
                      exercises. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that mock drills must be conducted on a routine
                      basis, and the states should be so well equipped that they may perform it on their own without the
                      financial support of the center.
                      <br>
                      The project was able to sensitize the concerned states and district administrators, but there is
                      still a lot of capacity development that needs to be catered to. On discussion, it was found that
                      there were gaps in the institutional understanding between NDMA and CSIR-NEIST, the release of
                      funds was a constraint, and some states such as Tripura are yet to submit the expenditure
                      statement of the funds utilized. There is also a lack of Disaster Management equipment with
                      different line departments such as foam tenders, mist technology, wood driller, inflators lighting
                      covers, high rise ladders, air lifting bags, pumping sets, and these equipment should be procured
                      at the earliest. Moreover, apart from procuring and maintaining the DM equipment, there should be
                      proper training of the manpower to operate them.
