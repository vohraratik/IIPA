                      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      The Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded project "SECURE Himalaya" is being implemented by the
                      Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), Government of India in
                      collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in the states of Jammu and
                      Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Sikkim. The project aims to promote sustainable land
                      and forest management in high range Indian Himalayan ecosystems through a landscape-based
                      approach. Under the SECURE Himalayan project, the Indian Institute of Public Administration
                      (IIPA), New Delhi executed a project titled "Assessment of capacities and training needs of key
                      stakeholders for long-term effective biodiversity conservation" in Sikkim, sponsored by UNDP. The
                      goal of this project was to develop a capacity building framework to enhance the capacities of key
                      stakeholders such as government line departments, research and training institutions, community
                      institutions, and NGOs in Sikkim for long-term biodiversity conservation. The present study
                      conducted a training needs assessment involving gap analysis to develop a strategy to train
                      different stakeholders and bridge gaps at various levels. The report presents the methodology
                      used, findings based on key stakeholder responses and expert consultations, as well as
                      recommendations and comments summarized from consultations and expert opinions. Three training
                      modules were developed as project deliverables to enhance the capacities of key stakeholders in
                      Sikkim, including a generic module providing basic information on biodiversity, conservation, and
                      mainstreaming, and two sector-specific modules focusing on Agriculture and Biodiversity, and
                      Sustainable Tourism, respectively. The outlines of the three modules are detailed in the report.

                    <p>
                      This project was designed to ensure a comprehensive and effective assessment of the training needs
                      of key stakeholders. The methodology involves the following steps:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Desk Review:</strong> A comprehensive review of literature, reports, policies, and
                        best practices
                        related to biodiversity conservation, capacity building, and sustainable development in the
                        Himalayan region and Sikkim was conducted. That helped to identify gaps and challenges in the
                        existing capacity-building initiatives and provide a foundation for the training needs
                        assessment.</li>
                      <li><strong>Stakeholder Identification:</strong> The key stakeholders involved in biodiversity
                        conservation in
                        the Sikkim region was identified. That includes government line departments, research and
                        training institutions, community institutions, and NGOs.</li>
                      <li><strong>Training Needs Assessment:</strong> A survey questionnaire was developed and
                        administered to the
                        identified stakeholders to assess their level of knowledge and skills related to biodiversity
                        conservation and capacity-building initiatives. The survey also seek feedback on the
                        capacity-building initiatives and identify areas where further training was needed. Focus group
                        discussions and interviews with key stakeholders was also conducted to gain a deeper
                        understanding of the challenges faced and the opportunities for capacity building.</li>
                      <li><strong>Gap Analysis:</strong> The data collected from the training needs assessment was
                        analysed to identify
                        the gaps and challenges in the capacity-building initiatives.</li>
                      <li><strong>Framework Development:</strong> Based on the findings of the training needs assessment
                        and gap
                        analysis, a capacity-building framework was developed that outlines the specific areas where
                        training was needed, the target audience for each training module, and the training approach.
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Training Module Development:</strong> Three training modules was developed to enhance
                        the capacities
                        of key stakeholders. The modules were generic in nature and sector-specific, focusing on
                        Agriculture and Biodiversity and Sustainable Tourism. The modules developed were based on the
                        findings of the training needs assessment and was designed to bridge the gaps identified during
                        the gap analysis.</li>
                      <li><strong>Training Delivery:</strong> The training modules was delivered to the key stakeholders
                        identified
                        during the stakeholder identification phase. The training was conducted through workshops,
                        seminars, and online sessions.</li>
                      <li><strong>Evaluation: </strong> The effectiveness of the training was evaluated using pre- and
                        post-training
                        assessments. The evaluation helps to identify the impact of the training on the knowledge,
                        skills, and attitudes of the stakeholders and the effectiveness of the capacity-building
                        framework. Based on the evaluation, the training modules and the framework were revised and
                        updated as needed.</li>

                      The project conducted a comprehensive training needs analysis to identify stakeholders and assess
                      their current capacities and gaps to meet the objective of enhancing long-term biodiversity
                      conservation in Sikkim's SECURE Himalayan Project landscapes. The analysis covered technical,
                      managerial, and other aspects of organizational working, providing a clear view of the present
                      scenario of biodiversity conservation in the state. Stakeholders were categorized into different
                      groups based on their existing mandates and potential for mainstreaming biodiversity
                      interventions. These groups included Core Line Departments, Core Enforcement Agencies, Non-Core
                      Line Departments, Core Hand-holding Training Institutes/potential training implementers, and
                      Community-Based organizations/Non-Governmental organizations. The Core Line Departments were
                      further divided into senior and grassroot level officers based on their roles and responsibilities
                      within the department.
