                      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      In 1998, the Government of India initiated the TePP Scheme as a joint effort between the DSIR's
                      Programme Aimed at Technological Self Reliance (PATSER) Scheme and the Department of Science and
                      Technology's (DST) Home Grown Technology (HGT) Programme of Technology Information Forecasting and
                      Assessment Council (TIFAC). This scheme aimed to promote innovation and entrepreneurship among all
                      sections of Indian society. TePP Outreach Centers (TUCs) were established throughout the country
                      to attract talented individuals and facilitate the conversion of their innovations into viable
                      commercial ventures. Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) conducted a study that
                      revealed the success of the TePP program. To publicize and promote the TUCs, marketing strategies
                      such as print media, seminars, conferences, radio, national events, innovation camps, NGOs,
                      Entrepreneurship Development Programs (EDPs), Faculty Development Programs (FDPs), and internet
                      were employed by TUC coordinators. The majority of the innovators and entrepreneurs in Phase I and
                      Phase II belonged to the first generation. There was a greater interest in innovation among the
                      current generation than in previous generations. In Phase I, product innovations constituted 96.7%
                      of the innovations, while in Phase II, the percentage was 95%. Healthcare, mechanical, and
                      biotechnology were the areas of focus in Phase I. Phase II saw an increase in healthcare
                      innovations (30%) and a reduction in biotechnology innovations (10.5%). The impact of the TePP
                      Scheme was found to have improved the quality of life for many people by introducing innovative
                      techniques in various areas, including oriental remedies, artificial cell culture manufacturing,
                      and skin treatment plants.

                    <p>The evaluation used a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. The
                      quantitative data were collected through a survey of TePP-supported projects, while the
                      qualitative data were collected through interviews with key stakeholders, including TePP
                      officials, entrepreneurs, and experts in the field of technopreneurship.
                      <br>
                      The survey collected data on the profile of the TePP-supported projects, their achievements, and
                      the impact of the TePP programme on their development. The survey also collected data on the
                      challenges faced by the projects and their suggestions for improving the programme's design and
                      implementation.
                      <br>
                      The qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders. The
                      interviews aimed to gather in-depth information on the stakeholders' perspectives on the TePP
                      programme, its strengths and weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.

                      <li>Creation of a pool of successful technopreneurs: TePP had created a pool of successful
                        technopreneurs who had commercialized their products and services and were now mentoring and

                      </li>
                      <li>Encouragement and promotion of entrepreneurship: TePP had played a significant role in
                        encouraging
                        and promoting entrepreneurship in the country, particularly among individuals and small-scale

                      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>The Technopreneur Promotion Programme (TePP) is a unique scheme that supports innovators in India
                      without requiring collateral security. Since its inception, the scheme has fostered an innovation
                      and entrepreneurship culture in the country. However, there is a need to modify the existing
                      process to make the scheme more successful and sustainable in the long run. To achieve this, the
                      scheme should become more innovator-centric and provide maximum autonomy to entrepreneurs to
                      generate enthusiasm among individuals. The existing network with industries can be explored for a
                      market-driven approach to strengthen the linkage between industry and innovation.
                      <br>
                      To promote an entrepreneurial approach, the scheme must reduce the processing time for various
                      operations, including fund disbursement, to reduce project costs, prevent technology obsolescence,
                      and keep innovators motivated. The views of industry experts should be considered when disbursing
                      funds, as the paucity of funds has led to delays. There is an immediate need to increase the
                      financial resources allocated to the scheme. The system should be flexible and not generalized, as
                      every innovation is unique.
                      <br>
                      The scheme can emphasize monitoring rather than evaluation for better impact, and the fund-related
                      issues can be simplified by smoothening the internal processes to enhance beneficiaries'
                      satisfaction levels. Provision of technical and non-technical skills training to beneficiaries
                      would encourage their involvement. Experts from the industry should be included in the screening
                      committee to create a market-driven flare for innovation. This linkage would help in generating
                      self-employment opportunities and foster industry-academia partnerships.
                      <br>
                      The visibility of the scheme can be increased by creating awareness at the regional and national
                      levels through in-depth promotional sessions and targeting academic institutes and media. Since
                      Technical Up-gradation Centres (TUCs) play a significant role in the scheme's success, the
                      selection of TUCs should be done judiciously. Institutions having innovation incubator cells like
                      IIM, IITs, and NID should be given priority during TUC selection, or their model should be
                      replicated to make the scheme more successful. To increase the accountability of the TUCs, a
                      continuous follow-up of TUC coordinators is recommended to improve the monitoring system, leading
                      to a reduction in the number of unsuccessful projects and an increased conversion rate. The Indian
                      Institute of Public Administration recommends the continuation of the TePP scheme.
